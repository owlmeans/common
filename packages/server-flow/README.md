# @owlmeans/server-flow

The **@owlmeans/server-flow** package provides server-side flow management functionality for OwlMeans Common Libraries, extending the core flow system with server-specific operations and integrations for backend applications.

## Purpose

This package serves as the server-side implementation of the OwlMeans flow system, designed for:

- **Server Flow Management**: Handle flow operations on the server side
- **Backend Integration**: Integrate flows with server contexts and services
- **State Persistence**: Manage flow state in server environments
- **API Integration**: Provide flow functionality through server APIs
- **Cross-service Flows**: Support flows that span multiple backend services

## Key Concepts

### Server-side Flows
Extends the base flow functionality with server-specific operations and persistence mechanisms.

### Backend State Management
Handles flow state management in server environments with appropriate persistence and scaling considerations.

### Service Integration
Integrates with OwlMeans server services and contexts for comprehensive backend flow support.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @owlmeans/server-flow
```

## API Reference

*Note: This package appears to be in template/early development stage.*

### Basic Structure

The package is designed to provide server-side flow functionality as an extension of the core flow system.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Server Flow Integration

```typescript
import { makeServerContext } from '@owlmeans/server-context'
// Server flow functionality (specific API depends on implementation)

const context = makeServerContext(config)
// Register server flow services and handlers
```

## Dependencies
