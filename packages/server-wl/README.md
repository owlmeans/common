# @owlmeans/server-wl

The **@owlmeans/server-wl** package provides server-side whitelist functionality for OwlMeans Common Libraries, enabling backend applications to implement and enforce whitelist-based access control, resource filtering, and security policies.

## Purpose

This package serves as the server-side whitelist management system, designed for:

- **Server Access Control**: Implement whitelist-based access control on the server
- **Resource Protection**: Protect server resources using whitelist rules
- **API Security**: Secure API endpoints with whitelist-based authorization
- **Policy Enforcement**: Enforce security policies and access rules
- **Integration Support**: Integrate with OwlMeans authentication and authorization systems

## Key Concepts

### Server-side Whitelisting
Provides robust whitelist enforcement mechanisms for server applications with centralized policy management.

### Resource Access Control
Controls access to server resources, API endpoints, and services based on configured whitelist rules.

### Policy-based Security
Implements security policies using whitelist rules that can be dynamically configured and updated.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @owlmeans/server-wl
```

## API Reference

*Note: This package appears to be in template/early development stage.*

### Basic Structure

The package is designed to provide server-side whitelist functionality as part of the OwlMeans security framework.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Server Whitelist Integration

```typescript
import { makeServerContext } from '@owlmeans/server-context'
// Server whitelist functionality (specific API depends on implementation)

const context = makeServerContext(config)
// Register whitelist services and middleware
```
